# Running JSBin

You need to install jsbin's ``node_modules`` before you can run this.

From the root of the repo:

```
cd jsbin
../node-v0.10.27/npm install
```

Double click on ``start-jsbin.bat``. The ``.bat`` file needs to be in the same directory as ``jsbin/`` and ``node-v0.10.27/``.

By default, the script will start JSBin on port 3000. Go to localhost:3000 (or <YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3000) to use it.
